{"name":"Diffutils","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git","body":"README for GNU DIFF\r\n\r\nThis directory contains the GNU diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp utilities.\r\nTheir features are a superset of the Unix features and they are\r\nsignificantly faster.\r\n\r\nPlease see the file COPYING for copying conditions.\r\n\r\nPlease see the file doc/version.texi for version information.\r\n\r\nPlease see the file doc/diffutils.texi (or doc/diffutils.info) for\r\ndocumentation that can be printed with TeX, or read with the 'info'\r\nprogram or with Emacs's 'M-x info'.  Brief man pages are in man/*,\r\nbut they are no substitute for the documentation.\r\n\r\nPlease see the file ABOUT-NLS for notes about translations.\r\n\r\nPlease see the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation\r\ninstructions.  Briefly, you can run \"./configure; make install\".  The\r\ncommand \"./configure --help\" lists the supported --enable and --with\r\noptions.\r\n\r\nIf you have a problem with internationalization, you might be able to\r\nwork around it as described in ABOUT-NLS by invoking './configure\r\n--disable-nls'.  Many of the problems arise from dynamic linking\r\nissues on non-GNU platforms (e.g. with the iconv library).  Such\r\nproblems tend to be shared by other GNU applications on these\r\nplatforms, and can usually be fixed by carefully tweaking your non-GNU\r\ninstallation.  If you have an older version of libiconv, please\r\nupgrade to the latest one; see <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libiconv/>.  If\r\nthe problem seems isolated to diffutils, though, please report a bug.\r\n\r\nThis program requires a Standard C compiler (C89 or later).  If you\r\nhave a nonstandard compiler, please install GCC first.\r\n\r\nIf you make changes to the source code, you may need appropriate\r\nversions of GNU build tools to regenerate the intermediate files.  The\r\nfollowing versions were used to generate the intermediate files in\r\nthis distribution:\r\n\r\n* Autoconf 2.59   <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.59.tar.gz>\r\n* Automake 1.8.3  <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/automake-1.8.3.tar.gz>\r\n* gettext 0.14.1  <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gettext/gettext-0.14.1.tar.gz>\r\n* help2man 1.33   <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/help2man/help2man-1.33.1.tar.gz>\r\n* Texinfo 4.7     <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/texinfo-4.7.tar.gz>\r\n\r\nFor any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in this package\r\nnote that the range specifies every single year in that closed interval.\r\n\r\nPlease report bugs to <bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org>.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 1992, 1998, 2001-2002, 2004, 2009-2013 Free Software Foundation,\r\nInc.\r\n\r\nThis file is part of GNU Diffutils.\r\n\r\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\r\nunder the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or\r\nany later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no\r\nInvariant Sections, with no Front-Cover Texts, and with no Back-Cover\r\nTexts.
