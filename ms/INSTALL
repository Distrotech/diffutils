This directory is for building GNU diffutils on PC operating systems.
It currently assumes GCC with either DJGPP or emx.

To build, do the following:

	cd ..
	make -f pc\makefile env=ENV
	# edit makefile, particularly checking `prefix' and `exec_prefix'
	make OS-TARGET

where

	ENV is either `djgpp' or `emx',
	OS is either `dos' or `os2', and
	TARGET is either `debug' or `release'.

Makefiles may contain targets that do not apply on your host.
